page-navtitle: Why use Markdown for Jekyll sites?
categories: misc meta
page-excerpt: So it turns out that I came up with a reason _not_ to use asciidoc for jekyll sites.

While I much prefer asciidoc, it doesn't give me one important feature that markdown does: In-line html.
 
 As much as it annoys me, asciidoc doesn't provide an easy way of adding semantic markup to post content, and therefore I've had to rely on appending a block of json to the end of the article. Fine for defining the data, but less useful for linking that data to specific text.
