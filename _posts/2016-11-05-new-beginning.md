:page-excerpt: No idea how long this will last, but at least it's up and running.

I've made a resolution to actually maintain a personal site so I can blog about the sort of crap I do development-wise. I've tried using blogging platforms, but I'd much rather handle my blogging via version control.

I'll try and keep the content here on-topic, but don't expect anything more than a stream of consciousness rant from anything I publish.

That being said, I've got plenty of stuff to add https://youtu.be/OQnd5ilKx2Y[my uninformed ad-hoc reckon] to, and I'm sure that if you end up reading this, you'll be chomping at the bit to reckon something yourself.
