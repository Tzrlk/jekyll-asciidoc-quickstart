I've been thinking a lot about three cheery Greek myths for a while, as working with [Docker][docker_home] has certainly made me empathise with their plights in different ways.

## Sisyphus

Our first (and arguably most famous) of the three is [Sisyphus][sisyphus_wiki], embodiment of back-breaking, will-shaking labour, that just as you reach completion gets snatched away at the last moment.

## Tantalus

The second-most relatable of the three, [Tantalus][tantalus_wiki] embodies the sweet release of a glorious success, _just_ out of reach no matter how hard you try.

## The Danaides

![danaides_img]

While very similar to Sisyphus in terms of being punished with an impossible and pointless task for all eternity, [the 50 daughters of Danaus][danaides_wiki] bring their own unique charm to the equation, and embody the despondent pointlessness of it all.
