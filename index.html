</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And of course, there are always the character optimisation guides:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://rpgbot.net/dnd5/characters/classes/warlock/">RPG BOT: The Warlock Handbook</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach I&#8217;d like to take on this is to offer a straightforward update that makes Warlock&#8217;s competitive with the least amount of effort. The fix consists of just a few minor modifications:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add Patron spells to Spells Known instead of the regular spell list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just add all the 1/day spell invocations to the regular spell list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the number of spell slots by 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the number of invocations by 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert pact boons into invocations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, there are a good number of other grievances I have with the class, but none of them can be solved with quick fixes like the one above. One of the good things that 4th edition did was look at exactly what roles each class has in a party, and set the Warlock as a high-DPR "Striker" type. The 5th edition version of the Warlock definitely has all the bits needed to make it a high-damage striker, but that creates a necessary feature tax that means you can&#8217;t be much else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Really, I&#8217;d like to know exactly what the Warlock is <em>for</em>, so the various mechanics can be altered to suit. Originally the warlock was all about the eldritch blast, and having various ways of altering it, as well as some nifty tricks. The thing that made warlocks particularly interesting is that unlike pretty much every other magic class, they could go all-day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There have been some attempts at adding blast-shape invocations to the Warlock to capture the feel of the original again, but with each class I look at and end up unhappy with, I think, <em>how would the Book of Nine Swords build it?</em> The mechanics there were awesome, because they created an opportunity for martial classes to have various kinds of interesting gameplay. It wasn&#8217;t perfect, but it leads us down a train of thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If one were to apply a similar thought process to the Warlock, you&#8217;d want to add a number of blast shapes and bizarre tactical abilities that can be selected as you level. I&#8217;d also probably replace the spellcasting with Truenamer Utterances from Tome of Magic. This would retain the can-go-all-day vibe of the Warlock without being too much of a pain. You might even be able to do away with Invocations by converting them into Utterances, and making the pact boon stuff just part of the class features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I planned for this post to be a lot more comprehensive and well-thought-out, but I reason that its probably better to get my bullshit stream-of-consciousness ranting published rather than languishing forever in my drafts folder. I&#8217;ll probably do a follow-up at some point to add in some concrete implementation suggestions.</p>

				<p>I've been working on my own RPG for a while, and after at just a decade, think that WaRP is a good base.</p>
				<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think about role-playing systems a lot, reading through everything I can get my hands on and critiquing each asked for how well it fulfills it&#8217;s purpose in making the game fun.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to strike a balance between crunchiness and fluidity for a while. Mostly I err on the side of simulation, but since the setting in working with is a dreamscape, that ends up being less than appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three systems I think I can munge together to create what I&#8217;ve been after, those being <a href="http://www.atlas-games.com/warp/">WaRP</a>, <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/dont-rest-your-head-2/">Don&#8217;t Rest Your Head</a>, and <a href="http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page9/page9.html">Mythic</a>. Each of these is used to create a particular feel for their games, but alone don&#8217;t fit for mine.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="don_t_rest_your_head">Don&#8217;t Rest Your Head</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This game, <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/dont-rest-your-head-2/">published by Evil Hat</a>, pictures you as a super-insomniac that through your exhaustion has learned that there is a reality behind this one, and it&#8217;s not a nice place. Now that you know about it, you&#8217;re a target.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The feature I&#8217;m most interested in with this one is the use of the dice system to create side-effects in the scene. There are 4 kinds of dice, and if during a challenge one of these groups is responsible for the highest individual die roll, there can be thematic repercussions to your character and/or the scene as a result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I always had the idea of having multiple forces that act on characters in the setting to make them miserable or to act as a dangerous source of power, so this method speaks to me.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="mythic">Mythic</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being a GM and being in control of the situation is great, but when you&#8217;re running a game completely off-the-cuff, it helps to be able to have some assistance when eyeballing it. Enter Mythic and it&#8217;s interesting <a href="http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page9/page9.html">GM Emulator</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Long story short, the emulator gives you a table of probabilities, and a reasonably straightforward process by which you can arrange and mutate scenes as the story progresses. The core of this is the asking of yes/no questions and using the table and a d100 roll to answer them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how much of that I&#8217;d want to throw into the game, but having a way to answer questions during a scene about details that you may not have worked out beforehand is great, and at the very least, another tool at the GM&#8217;s disposal.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="warp">WaRP</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core of this post, <a href="http://www.atlas-games.com/warp/">WaRP</a> is the underlying system behind Over The Edge, and uses a dice mechanic similar to <a href="http://7thsea.com/">7th Sea</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each character gets a small set of reasonably broad traits, and can use this to overcome challenges by rolling a number of dice equal to the trait, adding bonus dice if applicable, and choosing a number of dice to actually use in the final result equal to their trait value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It gets way more complicated of course, but the essence of "kept" and "unkept" dice gives you a decent probability curve, and allows you to throw on all sorts of bonuses without changing the maximum result. That being said, exploding rolls is one of the features, and that should provide any necessary lucky breaks the characters might need.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I love tinkering with systems, but eventually I&#8217;ll need to battle test this all together against some real players.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, I could always use the Mythic emulator to emulate players as well&#8230;&#8203;</p>

				<p>So I've been trying to get mockito working in one of my projects, and it's not going as well as I'd hoped. I'm not yak shaving any more, I'm being stonewalled.</p>
				<div class="paragraph">
<p>With any luck, venting about this here will lead me to the correct answer via the highly effective process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, I&#8217;ve been attempting to convert the haphazard pile of bash scripts used to prevent bad pushes to the git repository at work into an invoked cli jar compiled from kotlin. For the most part, the conversion process has gone well. I haven&#8217;t had the chance to properly refactor and reengineer it yet, but that should come after I can get the damn tests passing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had already been using <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=shunit2">shunit2</a> via <a href="https://github.com/aetheric/shunit2">my own 'fork' of it</a> to make sure all the bash scripts worked like I expected, but as you might imagine, that was super clunky to run and maintain. Converting everything to kotlin was fairly straightforward, and I ended up using a neat set of libraries:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/npryce/hamkrest">hamkrest</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/springockito/springockito">springockito</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nhaarman/mockito-kotlin">mockito-kotlin</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pholser/junit-quickcheck">junit-quickcheck</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/avh4/junit-nested">junit-nested</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Haven&#8217;t ended up getting too much use out of quickcheck just yet, but mockito-kotlin and hamkrest have been amazing in a kotlin environment. They&#8217;re little more than a thin veneer on top of the relevant libraries, but it makes things much simpler to write.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The thing that&#8217;s driving me nuts at the moment, however, is a pair of tests keep failing for a clear reason, but without the needed context to fix it. I even ended up creating a series of wrapper classes to avoid needing to mock things like RevCommit and ObjectId (jgit), but to no avail. Each and every time I run the damn thing I get the same set of errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is the stacktrace ends up being useless, since it&#8217;s only points to the place where the library raised the error, rather than the place that the error is complaining about. A few libraries like angularjs are notorious for this complete lack of context in their errors, meaning you end up waiting for the error to be thrown, then debugging backward through the process until you find what&#8217;s wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, in my case, the problem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUsSPAFmauY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=33s">is like an onion</a>. Every time I think I&#8217;ve stumbled across what&#8217;s causing the damn errors, I just uncover a new one that makes just as little sense as the first. Observe:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>java.lang.ClassCastException:
	org.mockito.internal.creation.cglib.ClassImposterizer
	$ClassWithSuperclassToWorkAroundCglibBug
	$EnhancerByMockitoWithCGLIB
	$$8b138c7f cannot be cast to
	...tools.git.wrappers.ObjectIdWrapper</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I love how descriptive the class names are, but it tells me almost nothing about why the hell this is happening. Casting that class should be perfectly fine if its 'extending' ObjectIdWrapper. The only thing I can think of is that it&#8217;s a bug somewhere between mockito and kotlin, and if that&#8217;s the case, then I should just flip a table and give up trying to have testable code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, in my efforts to get one test working, I end up breaking a bunch of other ones. Fml. Maybe I&#8217;ll have a flash of inspiration, but seeing how things have progressed so far makes that a very dim possibility.</p>
